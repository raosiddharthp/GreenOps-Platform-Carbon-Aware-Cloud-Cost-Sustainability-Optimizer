# Vision: Problem Statement & Strategic Objectives

This document establishes the strategic goals and core justification for the GreenOps Platform (TOGAF Phase A: Architecture Vision).

## 1. The Core Problem

Organizations face twin pressures: rising cloud infrastructure costs and increasing regulatory demands for sustainability reporting (e.g., EU CSRD, ESRS E1). Current cloud solutions typically treat **FinOps (Cost)** and **GreenOps (Carbon)** as separate, sometimes conflicting, initiatives, leading to wasted effort and unclear priorities.

The GreenOps Platform solves this by providing a unified architectural approach where cost and carbon optimization are inseparable design principles.

## 2. Strategic Objectives (The "Why")

The platform is designed to achieve the following business-critical outcomes:

| Objective | Business Goal | Metric (KPI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sustainability Compliance** | Achieve full EU CSRD (ESRS E1) reporting compliance. | 100% Audit Readiness |
| **Cost Optimization** | Reduce non-essential compute and storage expenditure. | 40% Cloud Cost Reduction |
| **Carbon Reduction** | Shift workloads to regions with high Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) sources. | 30% Emissions Reduction (Scope 2/3) |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Automate deployment and monitoring of GreenOps strategies. | 25% Quicker Initiative Adoption (SAFe) |
