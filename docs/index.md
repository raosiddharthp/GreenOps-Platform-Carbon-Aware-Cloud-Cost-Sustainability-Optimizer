---

This project showcases an Enterprise Architecture framework (based on TOGAF 10) for designing, implementing, and governing a cloud platform that prioritizes both **Cost Efficiency (FinOps)** and **Environmental Sustainability (GreenOps)**.

Use the navigation panel on the left to explore the complete set of architectural artifacts, from business strategy and stakeholder requirements to detailed technology implementation.

**Key Deliverables (Skills Demonstration):**
* **Architecture Vision (Customer/Vision):** Defining the need for FinOps/GreenOps alignment.
* **Business Architecture (Architecture/Business):** Defining capabilities and value streams for sustainability and cost reduction.
* **Technology Architecture (Architecture/Technology):** Designing the Carbon-Optimized GCP Landing Zone.
* **AI/ML Agents (Application/System Design):** Leveraging Vertex AI and open-source LLMs for carbon forecasting and workload shifting.
