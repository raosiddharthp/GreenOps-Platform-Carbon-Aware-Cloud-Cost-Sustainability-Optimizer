# Phase A – Architecture Vision

**GreenOps Platform**  
AI-powered carbon-aware cloud cost & sustainability optimizer for Google Cloud Platform  
Fully compliant with EU CSRD / ESRS E1 & E5

## Vision Statement
To become the leading enterprise platform that automatically reduces GCP carbon emissions by 30%+ and cloud costs by 40%+ while delivering fully automated, audit-ready ESG reporting — without requiring manual intervention from operations or sustainability teams.

## Strategic Goals
| Goal                              | Target                          | Owner                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Reduce Scope 2 & 3 emissions      | ≥ 30 % by end of FY26            | Elena Voss (CSO)       |
| Reduce GCP spend                  | ≥ 40 % average savings           | Sophia Patel (CIO)     |
| Achieve full CSRD compliance      | 100 % automated reporting Q1 2026| Compliance Director    |
| Zero-touch operations             | No manual scheduling or tagging  | Marcus Lind (Cloud Ops)|

## High-Level Scope
**In Scope**  
- Carbon-aware workload scheduling across GCP regions  
- Intelligent rightsizing & auto-scaling  
- Automated FinOps + GreenOps dashboards  
- CSRD/ESRS-compliant ESG report generation  

**Out of Scope (Phase 1)**  
- Multi-cloud support  
- On-prem workloads  
- Physical data-center emissions tracking  

## Key Principles
- Sustainability by default  
- Cost as a first-class metric alongside carbon  
- Full auditability and traceability  
- GCP-native (no agents, no sidecars)
