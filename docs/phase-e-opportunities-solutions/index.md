## Selected Solution Concept
**"GreenOps Autonomous Engine"** — Fully serverless, AI-driven, zero-touch platform on GCP.

**Alternative Options Evaluated & Rejected**:
| Option                     | Reason Rejected                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Third-party SaaS tool      | Vendor lock-in, no GCP-native carbon API  |
| Manual tagging + scripts   | Not scalable, error-prone                |
| On-prem carbon tool        | High cost, no real-time data             |

**Winner**: Build internally on GCP → full control, lowest TCO, fastest time-to-value.

**Status**: Solution concept approved by Architecture Board — 25 Dec 2025
