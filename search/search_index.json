The Core Problem","text":"<p>Organizations face twin pressures: rising cloud infrastructure costs and increasing regulatory demands for sustainability reporting (e.g., EU CSRD, ESRS E1). Current cloud solutions typically treat FinOps (Cost) and GreenOps (Carbon) as separate, sometimes conflicting, initiatives, leading to wasted effort and unclear priorities.</p> <p>The GreenOps Platform solves this by providing a unified architectural approach where cost and carbon optimization are inseparable design principles.</p>"},{"location":"customer/vision/#2-strategic-objectives-the-why","title":"2. Strategic Objectives (The \"Why\")","text":"<p>The platform is designed to achieve the following business-critical outcomes:</p> Objective Business Goal Metric (KPI) Sustainability Compliance Achieve full EU CSRD (ESRS E1) reporting compliance. 100% Audit Readiness Cost Optimization Reduce non-essential compute and storage expenditure. 40% Cloud Cost Reduction Carbon Reduction Shift workloads to regions with high Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) sources. 30% Emissions Reduction (Scope 2/3) Operational Efficiency Automate deployment and monitoring of GreenOps strategies. 25% Quicker Initiative Adoption (SAFe)"}]}
